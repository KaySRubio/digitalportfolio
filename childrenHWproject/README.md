    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>In a software engineering course, I coded a math program for children with a home page, tests, and homeworks. Below is an example of one of the math test pages.</p>
    <h2>HTML/CSS Skills</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Created unique page formats</li>
          <li>Coded a responsive design using media queries to format the page based on screen size</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>JavaScript Skills</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Declared functions for page actions</li>
                  <li>Selected DOM elements and updated their attributes to change the images and text</li>
                  <li>Created event listeners to run functions in response to click events</li>
                  <li>Declared arrays and variables to display the correct set of questions and images per grade, and keep track of student answers, and ensure each question is only answered once</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Using JavaScript, the page will:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep track of your answers</li>
          <li>Tell you right away if you got it right or not</li>
          <li>Increase your candy peppermint rewards for each correct answer</li>
          <li>Only let you answer each question once</li>
          <li>Display your answers, and completed questions at the bottom</li>
          <li>Let you submit once you are done</li>
          <li>Show you your final grade at the end</li>
          <li>Show a different message at the end depending on percent correct</li>
        </ul>
