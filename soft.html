      <h2>Soft Skills</h2>

      <div class="white_background">
      <h3>Teamwork Examples</h3>
        <div class="pp_col1of2">
          <h5 class="center">Company-Wide Workgroups</h5>
          <p><br>As a data manager (DM) at HealthCore, I recently initiated a multi-department workgroup to develop standards of procedure (SOP) to manage drug supply in clinical research studies. In the workgroup, I represent the data management department. We also have representatives from project management, statistics, and other departments. We are integrating all of our efforts into a whole company-wide SOP.</p><p>I am aware that my colleagues in other departments have different roles, interests, and levels of technical expertise.  We negotiate which departments should take on which tasks required for drug management.  It takes patience to resolve some of the issues where the division of labor has been unclear in the past.</p><p>My role is to standardize how DM sets up out software systems to manage drug supply tracking, shipments, and dispensing.  I make sure to communicate this information in a way that's not too technical for members of other departments.  I also delegate sub-tasks to other DM's outside the workgroup.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pp_col1of2">
        <h5 class="center">Feedback and Collaboration</h5>
         <p><br>My teamwork skills grew tremendously during my time as a research assistant at UMass Boston and Clark University.  Each research project and resulting publication is a group effort, and everyone takes on different roles after negotiating the authorship order.</p><p>On studies where I was the first author, I was responsible for overseeing all data collection, analysis, and writing.  In these situations, I solicit feedback from colleagues and am appreciative of the support. I either integrate their feedback or ensure to follow up with further discussion.</p><p>On publications where I'm second or third author, I don't lead each piece, but take on a specific piece. Because I developed a lot of statistics skills in grad school, professors and students would ask me to run the statistical analyses for their projects and write the results sections of their paper.  While I like to lead entire projects, I'm also OK taking a back seat and focusing on my specific task.</p>

      <h3>Project Management and Leadership Examples</h3>
      <div class="pp_col1of2">
        <h5 class="center">Organizing a Team</h5>
        <p><br>I am currently lead data manager on the <a href="https://covidmusicstudy.com/" target="_blank">MUSIC</a> study where I manage a team of 4 supporting DM's.</p><p>To lead the project successfully, I:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Write clear and detailed expectations for all tasks.  This involves writing SOP's, workflows, step-by-step directions with screenshots, etc. </li>
          <li>Create a written division of labor detailing who will perform each task and how often.</li>
          <li>Run a training program and ensuring that training is documented in writing on a training log, or other standardized form.</li>
          <li>Check-in regularly with team members to ensure that these tasks are being completed. Help resolve issues that arise. Double-check the documentation generated, especially for newer team members.</li>
          <li>Document major decisions that affect our tasks on meeting minutes or an ADIN log.</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="pp_col1of2">
        <h5 class="center">Teaching and Mentoring</h5>
        <p><br>My leadership skills developed during my time as a teaching assistant (TA) at Clark University. I improved my public speaking skills while giving lectures and facilitating group discussions in TA sections. I learned how important it is to know my audience's prerequisite knowledge, and tailor my presentation to their interests. This has been a useful skill that carries into my work life when I present for auditors, clients, and other teams.
        </p><p>While a TA, I also mentored undergraduate students who were doing their final thesis projects.  This involved reviewing their work and providing feedback in clear and polite way.  I learned that it was important to talk things through in person to clarify their questions and come to mutual decisions, and follow up to ensure they actually integrated the decisions we made.  I use these skills today to help train and mentor junior colleagues in the workplace.</p>
      </div>
        <h3>Writing Skills</h3>
        <div class="pp_col1of2">
          <h5 class="center">Audit-Ready Documentation</h5>
          <p><br>In my current position, I develop audit-ready documentation including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Human-readable audit trails detailing changes over time to SAS/SQL program code for data cleaning/report generating programs</li>
            <li>Data management plans and workflows</li>
            <li>Software Validation Plans that test core features of the software and summaries of the results</li>
            <li>User Acceptance Testing plans for study-specific electronic data capture systems, scripts, and result summaries</li>
            <li>Training slides and recorded video presentations showing users how to use the EDC</li>
            <li>Demonstrations and in-person explanations of the EDC's functionality to auditors and clients</li>
          </ul>
